/**
 * My own implementation of the Observer pattern, that overcomes some of the 
 * deficiencies of the Java library implementation.  This 
 * implementation addresses the following issues:
 *      1. removeSubscriber() finds the appropriate subscriber using 
 *         reference equality rather than the equals() method.
 *      2. clone() clears the subscriber list as we don't usually want to 
 *         have our subscribers subscribe to both the original and the clone
